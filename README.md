> An action to run Terraform Cloud workspaces

This action submits a run to a Terraform Cloud workspace which performs a plan and apply. The action can be configured to return a success once the run is succesfully submitted, or it can wait for the plan to be applied by periodically polling Terraform Cloud for run status updates.

## Usage

Terraform Cloud requires a .tar.gz archive containing the Terraform configuration, and build artifacts if required. The example shows a GitHub workflow archiving Lambda functions (in the `build` directory) alongside a Terraform configuration (in the `infrastructure` directory) for deployment. The archive is then passed to the action for deployment by Terraform Cloud.

```yml
- name: Create tar gz file
  run: tar --exclude *.terraform* -zcvf build.tar.gz build infrastructure

- name: Terraform Cloud
  uses: addresscloud/terraform-cloud-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    tfToken: ${{ secrets.TERRAFORM_TOKEN }}
    tfOrg: '<ORGANISATION>'
    tfWorkspace: 'my-lambda-service'
    filePath: './build.tar.gz'
    identifier: ${{ github.sha }}
```

### Inputs

The inputs below are required by the action to submit the run to Terraform Cloud. Additional workspace variables and settings should be configured using the Terraform Cloud UI. 

#### `tfToken`
 
**Required** 

Terraform Cloud access token.

#### `tfOrganization`

**Required** 

Terraform Cloud Organization.

#### `tfWorkspace`

**Required** 

Name of existing Terraform Cloud workspace.

#### `filePath`

**Required** 

Path to .tar.gz archive with Terraform configuration.

#### `identifier`

**Required** 

Unique identifier for the run (e.g. git commit sha). Reduced to 7 characters for brevity.

#### `awaitApply`

Wait for run to apply before completing.

Default: false

#### `awaitInterval`

Duration to wait (seconds) between sunsequent run status requests.

Default: 60

#### `retryLimit`

Number of times to retry Terraform Cloud API requests.

Default: 5

### Outputs

#### `runId` 

The identfier of the run in Terraform Cloud.

#### `status`

The status of the run in Terraform Cloud.

### Note on Terraform Modules

If your repository contains multiple modules, upload the top-level directory and configure the root workspace path in the Terraform Cloud UI. For example, to deploy 
`infrastructure/dev/services/lambda/main.tf` which has references to modules in `infrastructure/modules/services/lambda/module.tf` upload the entire `infrastructure` directory and configure `infrastructure/dev/services/lambda/` as the root of the workspace in the Terraform Cloud UI.
